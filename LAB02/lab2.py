Reflection

1. Considering the solutions you saw in the lab 1 code, what differences did you see between the fastest and slowest versions?
- Fast versions reduced unnecessary iterations and used efficient algorithms, and slow versions often used relatively redundant calculations or inefficient structures.

2. Was there a difference in terms of the usage of space resources? Did one algorithm use more/less space (memory)?
- There was a difference in terms of memory usage. For example, the Fibonacci function I implemented is very efficient (O(1) spatial complexity)
 as it stores only two previous values and uses very little space.
On the other hand, slow versions with recursive use more memory as calls pile up (O(n) spatial complexity).
In addition, the sum_to_goal function uses a set to store duplicate numbers, which requires some additional memory, but significantly improves the execution speed.
In conclusion, memory usage depends on whether the algorithm writes repetitions, writes recursions, and stores intermediate results.

3. What sort of conclusions can you draw based on your observations?
- Fast algorithms usually use less memory, and slow algorithms use more memory or use inefficient methods. 
Therefore, it can be concluded that it is important to consider not only time but also space (memory) efficiency when designing algorithms.
