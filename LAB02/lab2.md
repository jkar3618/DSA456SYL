## ✅ Summary

The Fibonacci implementation is most likely optimized. Repetition or memorization instead of recursion can lead to very fast execution.  
The 'sum_to_goal' function is also simple and efficient, and is likely to use loops or formulas to compute the results.  
Comparisons with other features were not possible, but the results indicate that both features were implemented with good time complexity.
